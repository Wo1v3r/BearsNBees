# BearsNBees

Bears and Bees is an idea born out of my own need of Project Ideas in order to learn new technologies.
Seeing as most of the Tutorials on Tech Documentation are too short for a newcomer to obtain a deep understanding of the skills and methods he used and most of the online tutorials (Udemy,YouTube,PluralSight,TreeHouse) are ill-project oriented, telling what to do step by step, the only real introduction of a tech stack for example, would be to create your own side project.

Bears and Bees is mainly aimed at newcomers who have no prior experience with development, and not only find it hard to think of an idea that will target the skills they need to strengthen also, don't really know exactly *What* to use in their project.

Depicting Bears as newcomers to a stack\idea, a Honey Pot as their Project, the Bears will put up their idea and wait for the bees help: Recommending relevant technologies, learning material, and even assisting in the project!
Moreover, the application should be generally used to quickly find ideas for a side project you want to start right away.


*Disclaimer:
Bears and Bess is NOT a replacement for development and collaboration environment such as GitHub vice versa, it endorses the use of GitHub and its' counterparts.*
